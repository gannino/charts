# Concourse Helm Chart

[Concourse](https://concourse.ci/) is a simple and scalable CI system.

This chart is adapted from https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable/concourse

Our adaptation only sets up the web portal and relies on external processes to setup the postgresql and workers.
